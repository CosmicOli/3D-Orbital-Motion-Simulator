# 3D-Orbital-Motion-Simulator
An interactive orbital motion simulator that uses Newtonian mechanics to create a compound error free model. While the camera is locked in rotation, all orbits are still calculated in 3D.

This was originally planned as a personal project, but was written as a computer science A Level NEA.

Controls:
Left click and drag to move around the simulation.
Scroll to zoom.
Right click on or near a body to get information about it and it's orbit.

See 3D Orbital Motion Simulation/NEA.docx for a comprehensive explanation of the interface, maths behind the project, and the structure of the code.
